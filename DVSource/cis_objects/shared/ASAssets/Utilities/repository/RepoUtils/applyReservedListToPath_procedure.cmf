    -- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
    This procedure is used to fix the leading characters and CIS reserved words used in a folder path.  
    Any path that contains a reserved word, leading underscore &apos;_&apos; or a number &apos;0123456789&apos;, or special
    character must have double quotes inserted around that portion of the folder.  This procedure would 
    be called in conjunction with other procedures.  For example, when generating a view based off of 
    another view, the SELECT statement&apos;s FROM clause would require that the path to the underlying view 
    be fixed with double quotes if it meets any of the quoting criteria above.
 
    Dependencies:
    =============
    $CIS_INSTALL_HOME/conf/customjars/RepoUtils.properties - This properties file on the CIS host filesystem 
        provides a list of reserved words and characters that are used to match with the various parts 
        of a folder path.  Add any new CIS reserved words that appear from release to release in this list. This
        file can be updated without a restart of CIS.

    Input:
        inPath - CIS source folder path to assess and fix
            Values: e.g. /shared/tmp/1folder/_folder/XML. If this is NULL, a NULL is returned.

		debug - This input is deprecated but included for backward compatibility.
			Values: Any string value or NULL. It is ignored.

    Output:
        fixedResourcePath - Fixed CIS source folder path
            Values: e.g. /shared/tmp/&quot;1folder&quot;/&quot;_folder&quot;/&quot;XML&quot;

    Exceptions:  none
