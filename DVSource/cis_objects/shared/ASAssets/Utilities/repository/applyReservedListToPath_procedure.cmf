    DEPRECATED: Will be removed in future release
        Replaced with Utilities/RepoUtils/applyReservedListToPath

    -- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
    This procedure is used to fix the leading characters and CIS reserved words used in a folder path.  
    Any path that contains a reserved word, leading underscore &apos;_&apos; or a number &apos;0123456789&apos; must have 
    double quotes inserted around that portion of the folder.  This procedure would be called in 
    conjunction with other procedures.  For example, when generating a view based off of another view, 
    the SELECT statement&apos;s FROM clause would require that the path to the underlying view be fixed 
    with double quotes if it finds.
 
    Dependencies:
    =============
    /shared/Utilities/repository/ConfigureReservedList - Provides a list of reserved words and characters
        that are used to match with the various parts of a folder path.  Add any new CIS reserved words
        that appear from release to release in this list.

    Input:
        resourcePath - CIS source folder path to assess and fix
            Values: e.g. /shared/tmp/1folder/_folder/XML

    Output:
        fixedResourcePath - Fixed CIS source folder path
            Values: e.g. /shared/tmp/&quot;1folder&quot;/&quot;_folder&quot;/&quot;XML&quot;

    Exceptions:  none
