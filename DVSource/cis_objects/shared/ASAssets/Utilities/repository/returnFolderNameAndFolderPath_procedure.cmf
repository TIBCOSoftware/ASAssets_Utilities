  <annotation>-- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
	Return the root folder name and the remaing folder path.  Used for traversing folder structures either
	top down or bottom up.  This procedure is also used when creating a folder structure from beginning to end.
 
	Input:
		fullResourcePath - Full resource path which includes the path and the resource name  
			Values: e.g. /shared/f1/f2/r1
		mode - defines the mode by which to extract folder path and root name  
			Values: B or E, &apos;B&apos;=beginning folder and remaining folder path, 
					&apos;E&apos;=ending folder remaining folder path
	Output:
		folderName - contains the root folder name extracted from the incoming fullResourcePath
		folderPath - contains the remaining folder path

		Example 1: CIS path example: /shared/f1/f2/r1
				when &apos;B&apos; then folderName=&apos;shared&apos; and folderPath=&apos;/f1/f2/r1&apos;
				when &apos;E&apos; then folderName=&apos;r1&apos; and folderPath=&apos;/shared/f1/f2&apos;

		Example 2: Windows path example: C:\d1\d2\file1
				when &apos;B&apos; then folderName=&apos;C:&apos; and folderPath=&apos;/d1/d2/file1&apos;
				when &apos;E&apos; then folderName=&apos;file1&apos; and folderPath=&apos;C:/d1/d2&apos;
