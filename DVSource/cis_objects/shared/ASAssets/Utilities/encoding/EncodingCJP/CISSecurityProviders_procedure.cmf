  <annotation>CISSecurityProviders

    Description:
        Lists all JCE providers, services and algorithms configured in the CIS JVM. A wrapper simple
        view, CIS_JCE_PROVIDERS_VIEW, on top of the procedure allows for the lookup of algorithms. This
        procedure can be used, for example, to track down the root cause of failures in a client certificate 
        and/or mutual authentication schemes between CIS and secure data providers (REST and SOAP web-services, 
        some DBMS with advanced security mechanisms) or clients (SOAP and REST service consumes, app 
        servers, ESBs, etc.) when these failures are caused by unsupported security algorithms.

    Input:
        N/A


    Output:
        results - The list of providers and their respective algorithms and service descriptions
            CURSOR (
                Provider              LONGVARCHAR
                Algorithm             LONGVARCHAR
                &quot;Service Description&quot; LONGVARCHAR
            )


    Exceptions:  none
