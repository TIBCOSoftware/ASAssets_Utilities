    UpdateDsColumnAnnotation:

    This procedure is used to update annotations for data source table columns (for other types of
    tables/views, please use the updateSqlTable() admin API.)

    Input:
        column_path - The path to the data source column.
        	Values: A CIS path

        annotation -  The text of the annotation.
        	Values: Any text value


    Output:
        result -      A message stating that the update completed successfully (an exception is thrown if
                      the column cannot be updated for some reason.)
        	Values: "Column annotation updated."

    Exceptions:  none
