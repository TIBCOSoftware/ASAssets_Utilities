/*
	Description:
	  This function uses Java's String.split() method to split a string using a regular expression and a limit.
	
	  Paraphrased from String's javadoc:
	
	  The cursor returned by this function contains each substring of this string that is terminated 
	  by another substring that matches the given expression or is terminated by the end of the 
	  string. The substrings in the cursor are in the order in which they occur in this string. If 
	  the expression does not match any part of the input then the resulting cursor has just one 
	  row, namely this string.
	
	  The limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects 
	  the length of the resulting cursor. If the limit n is greater than zero then the pattern will 
	  be applied at most n - 1 times, the cursor's cardinality will be no greater than n, and the cursor's 
	  last row will contain all input beyond the last matched delimiter. If n is non-positive 
	  then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible and the cursor can have any number of rows. 
	  If n is zero then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the cursor can have 
	  any number of rows, and trailing empty strings will be discarded.
	
	  The string 'boo:and:foo', for example, yields the following results with these parameters:
	
	  Regex   Limit   Result 
	    :       2     'boo', 'and:foo' 
	    :       5     'boo', 'and', 'foo' 
	    :      -2     'boo', 'and', 'foo' 
	    o       5     'b', '', ':and:f', '', '' 
	    o      -2     'b', '', ':and:f', '', '' 
	    o       0     'b', '', ':and:f'
	
	Inputs:
	  Input Text         - The text to search
	  Regular Expression - The regular expression to search for
	  Limit              - The upper limit to the number of times to apply the split
	
	Outputs:
	  result (           - A cursor containing a result set of the split string.
	    splitElement     -   Text of a split element
	  )
	
	Exceptions:
	  None
