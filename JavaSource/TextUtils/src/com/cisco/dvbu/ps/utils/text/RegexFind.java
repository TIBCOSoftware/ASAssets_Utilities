/*
	Description:
	  Finds an occurrence of a regular expression match in a VARCHAR and returns the match.
	  The value of the occurrence input value determines which occurrence to return (numbered
	  starting at 1 from left to right. Use negative values to number occurrences from right
	  to left.) If no match is found, then a NULL is returned. If a NULL value is passed in 
	  as the value of any of the inputs, a NULL is returned. Zero may not be used as a value
	  for an occurrence.
	
	  The regular expression language used is what is supported by the JDK used by CIS 
	  (currently 1.5 in CIS 4.0.1) See the javadoc for java.util.regex.Pattern for 
	  details on what is supported.
	
	Inputs:
	  Input Text         - The text to search
	  Regular Expression - The regular expression to search for
	  Occurrence         - The occurrance of the match (starting from 1 left to right or -1 right to left)
	
	Outputs:
	  result             - The matched text. NULL if no match found.
	
	Exceptions:
	  None
